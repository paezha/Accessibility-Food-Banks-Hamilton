  \begin{abstract}
  In this paper we analyze the changes in accessibility to emergency and
  community food services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the
  City of Hamilton, Ontario. Many of these food services are the last
  line of support for households facing food insecurity; as such, their
  relevance cannot be ignored in the midst of the economic upheaval
  caused by the pandemic. Our analysis is based on the application of
  balanced floating catchment areas and concentrates on households with
  lower incomes (\textless CAD40,000, approximately the Low Income
  Cutoff Value for a city of Hamilton's size). We find that
  accessibility was low to begin with in suburban and exurban parts of
  the city; furthermore, about 14\% of locations originally available in
  Hamilton closed during the pandemic, further reducing accessibility.
  The impact of closures on the level of service of the remaining
  facilities, and on accessibility, was disproportionate, with
  system-wide losses exceeding 40\%. Those losses were geographically
  and demographically uneven. While every part of the city faced a
  reduction in accessibility, inner suburbs fared worse in terms of loss
  of accessibility. As well, children (age \(\le 18\)) appear to have
  been impacted the most.
