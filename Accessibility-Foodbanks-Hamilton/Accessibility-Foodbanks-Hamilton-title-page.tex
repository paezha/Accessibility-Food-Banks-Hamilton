  \begin{abstract}
  In this paper we analyze the changes in accessibility to food banks
  and related services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the
  City of Hamilton, Ontario. Food banks and services are the last line
  of support for households facing food insecurity; as such, they have
  become essential and their relevance cannot be ignored in the midst of
  the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic. Our analysis is based on
  the application of balanced floating catchment areas, and concentrates
  on households with lower incomes (\$\textless CAD40,000, approximately
  the Low Income Cutoff Value for a city of Hamilton's size).
  Accessibility was low to begin with in suburban and exurban parts of
  the city. We find that about 14\% of locations originally available in
  Hamilton closed during the pandemic; the impact of those closures on
  the level of service and accessibility was disproportionate, with
  system-wide losses exceeding 40\%. Those losses were geographically
  and demographically uneven. While every part of the city faced a
  reduction in accessibility, inner suburbs fared worse in terms of loss
  of accessibility. As well, children (age \(\le 18\)) appear to have
  been impacted the most.
